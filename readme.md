# My personal ReactJS template

This project is an attempt of mine to create a single source of truth when starting a new ReactJS project. I feel like I'm going to be doing that a lot, so it's good to save some time of configuring.

This project has some features that I find interesting to the development process, which I'll be listing bellow:

* **Typescript** to make Javascript tolerable
* **Babel** to transpile our Typescript code into Javascript
* **React** fast refresh to speed up the development process
* **Webpack** to compile our static assets and generate our bundle
* **ESlint** to fix code problems
* **Prettier** to fix code structure
* **SASS** to make CSS fun to use

If you want to add or remove anything, feel free. This is what I have so far.

I'll upgrade and maintain this project as it grows. ðŸ˜Ž

Thank you for your time.
